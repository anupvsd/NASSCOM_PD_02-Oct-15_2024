Floor_Plan
After synthesis next step is to create floor plan 
In floorplan we are setting the die area, core area, aspect rato,utilization factor,we place i/o cells,we do power distribution (pg creation),macro placement.std cells not place in floor plan it happens in placement stage.
Below are the system deffault steps (files available inside the configuration directory)
